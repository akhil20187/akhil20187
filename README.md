### Hi there! 👋 I'm Akhil

### About Me

🌱 Continuous learner on a journey to unlock the potential of Artificial Intelligence, diving deep into Stable Diffusion models, ComfyUI, Python wizardry, LLM fine-tuning, and more. I am an aspiring AI aficionado. I love to explore new tools and explore how it can change the life of the user. 

### What I Do

🚀 A seasoned Product Enthusiast & Operations Strategist with over 13 years of exhilarating adventures across startups like Swiggy, ZestMoney, and Recykal, just to name a few. My passion? Crafting and scaling disruptive products that shake up the status quo.

♻️ At Recykal, I spearheaded game-changing products in the waste management realm, championing W-COMMERCE (yes, that's Waste Commerce), infusing transparency and traceability into every aspect of the value chain.

🌱 As Head of Operations at Kheyti, a social impact powerhouse, I collaborated with farmers to cultivate success in mini greenhouses, transforming lives one harvest at a time.

💡 Prior stints include orchestrating success at ZestMoney, where I revolutionized credit decisions and Salesforce implementations, and navigating the high-speed lanes of hyperlocal logistics at Swiggy, strategizing from scratch to launch operations in Hyderabad.

🚀 Oh, did I mention I'm an entrepreneurial spirit? Experienced the exhilarating rollercoaster of launching and learning with own ventures, Kapow Ideas Marketing & Switcheko.
